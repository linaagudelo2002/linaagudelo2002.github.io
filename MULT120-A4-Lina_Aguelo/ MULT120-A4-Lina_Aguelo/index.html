                        in Vega Baja in 2016, Bad Bunny released music as an independent artist on SoundCloud, where his song "Diles" caught the attention of DJ Luian 
                        who signed him to his record label, Hear this Music. DJ Luian introduced Bad Bunny to the production team Mambo Kingz, who were 
                        intrigued by Bad Bunny's musical experimentation and style of dress.[18] Since then, he has earned multiple top-ten entries on the US Hot Latin Songs chart.
                         His breakthrough single, "Soy Peor", established him as a forerunner in the Latin American trap scene and reached number 22 on the Hot Latin Songs chart.
                        Ten months after the video for "Soy Peor"'s release, it reached 330 million views on YouTube. His song "Krippy Kush" featuring Farruko also became a success.
                         Bad Bunny's May 2017 collaboration with Karol G, "Ahora Me Llama", garnered more than 756 million views on YouTube and reached number 10 on the Billboard Hot
                         Latin Songs chart.[20] The song was described by Marty Preciado of NPR as a "bass-heavy, unapologetic trap anthem to the power of femininity, soiled in hi-hats 
                         and heavy sub-bass [that] challenges hegemonic masculinity, singing about respect, love and sex-positive decisions. "Ahora Me Llama" was listed on 
                         "Alt.Latino's Favorites: The Songs Of 2017" as one of the best Latin songs of 2017.
